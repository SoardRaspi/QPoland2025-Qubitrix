## Project Description
What is Quantum Tunneling?

Quantum tunneling is one of the most fascinating consequences of quantum mechanics — it allows a particle to pass through an energy barrier even when it doesn’t have enough classical energy to climb over it.

In classical physics, a ball rolling in a valley cannot cross the hill unless it gains enough kinetic energy.
In quantum mechanics, however, the “ball” behaves like a wave — and part of that wave can penetrate and even leak through the barrier.
This probability of “leaking through” is the tunneling amplitude, and it plays a crucial role in nanoscale and superconducting systems.

⚡ Quantum Tunneling in Josephson Junctions

In a current-biased Josephson Junction (JJ) — two superconductors separated by a thin insulating barrier — the dynamics of the phase difference behave like a quantum particle in a tilted washboard potential.

At low bias current, the “phase particle” sits stably in one of the potential wells (no voltage).

As the bias current increases, the potential tilts, and the barrier between wells becomes shallower.

When the particle tunnels through the barrier, the junction switches to a finite voltage state.

This macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) — where a macroscopic variable (the superconducting phase) exhibits microscopic quantum behavior — lies at the heart of superconducting qubits (used in IBM, Google, and Rigetti quantum processors).

### Methods and objectives
Nobel Prize 2025: Quantum Tunneling & Its Relevance to Our Project

In 2025, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis “for the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunneling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit.”

Their milestone experiments in the 1980s used Josephson junctions — superconducting circuits — to show that a macroscopic system (made of billions of particles) could behave like a single quantum particle. 
Physics

They observed quantum tunneling: the circuit could switch from a zero-voltage state to a finite-voltage state by “tunneling through” an energy barrier, in full analogy with quantum particles.

They also demonstrated energy quantization (discrete energy levels) in that circuit, which is exactly the kind of “artificial atom” behavior that underpins superconducting qubits.

Why This Matters for Our Project:

Our Josephson-junction-inspired QAOA / optimization algorithms are deeply rooted in the same physics that earned the Nobel. We model macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) as a mechanism for “spin flips” or transitions in an optimization landscape.

By simulating how a JJ would behave (escape rates, switching probabilities, etc.), we are essentially leveraging the very phenomenon the laureates discovered and used to build quantum circuits.

Their work laid the foundation for superconducting qubits, which are widely used in real quantum computers. Our use of JJ-based mixers or tunneling-inspired dynamics in QAOA is a conceptual descendant of their pioneering experiments.
